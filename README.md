# Rvalue_3D

**Date created:** July 01, 2024

**Project reference:** Biswal et al. 2024; doi: ---

**About:** Codes and results corresponding to a few magnetic metadata parameters in 3D; namely, 
1. total length of PILs
2. maximum length of PILs and 
3. unsigned flux
4. R-value

**Contents:** This repository has 3 directories, one each for the codes, data and plots. Each directory is further divided into 4 sub-directories, based on the type of dataset (see below).  

**Flare dataset details:** 
1. X-class cases (8 cases)
2. M-class cases (4 cases)
3. C class cases (1 case)
4. Non-flaring/Quiescent ARs (3 cases), denoted by 'Zero' sub-directory

**Important:** While running the code files to view the results on a local machine, please modify the directory path appropriately (see issue #1).
